# Smart_Room_Occupancy_Monitor
This project implements a smart room automation system using an Arduino Uno to monitor room occupancy and control a fan automatically. Two IR sensors are installed at different doors to detect entry and exit, allowing the system to maintain a real-time count of people inside the room. A 16×2 LCD displays the current occupancy, and when the count becomes zero, the fan automatically turns OFF to conserve energy, ensuring efficient power management and intelligent room control.
